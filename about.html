                        <p>In recent times there are stories all over local and national news outlets about people vanishing on the appalachian trail, secret national park projects, feral-cannibal people, bigfoot, skinwalkers, devil monkeys and much more.
                           Even though rumors like bigfoot are from the Pacific Northwest, and Skinwalkers are from the South West, folklore has been around for a very long time.
                           With the vast expance of the Appalachian mountains, the dense forests and remote peaks, there is no wonder that so many get drawn into the story telling and rumors often spread about the region.
                           Despite all of this the reason why Appalachia is set apart from any other ranges or regions on earth is one based in science that astounds many enough to ignore the troubled talk and seek out the raw beauty that the it holds.
                           
                           <Em>
                        </Em>
                        </p>
                        <p> Many people consider Appalachia to be limited to Maryland when going North, though at a time the region extended all the way up into Canada off the Coast of Newfenland to a tiny island called Belle Isle. 
                            Many of the Appalachian mountains have been known to have started forming almost a half billion years ago, being the oldest mountain range on earth. This before pangea, before the dinosaurs and with the advent of marine life.
                            This mountain range started with two tectonic plates colliding, their formations erroding, and then 100 million years later, colliding again to form many jagged peaks.
                            Then 110 million years later Africa slammed into America moving these mountains inland creating one of the most geologically complex mountain ranges on earth that we see today.
                            Much more recently, around 10,000 years ago the Northern Appalachians were buried under massive glaciers and many species migrated south to avoid extinction.
                            As tempatures rose again, many species travelled higher in altitude to stay in colder climates like they were used, stranding them in these locations, creating unique biologicals islands.
                            The far north consists of artic tundras with bears, elk, deer, artic foxs and even great auks(basically a penguin), while the southern appalachian mountians are some of the rainiest placest in the U.S coming second to only the Pacific North West.
                            Lush temperate rainforests, heavy rains that created many rivers and streams, allowing for the growth of thousands of species, many unique to the region found nowhere else on earth. 
                            With all of these ecological inconsistencies and the indiginous people living in the valleys of these regions for thousands of years numbered in the hundreds, its no wonder the folklore has thrived so much with all of these unique variables in play.
