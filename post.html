                        <p> Appalchia's history often has a historically negative take, many of the positives being removed from the general timeline to cater to a certain understanding.
                        We hope that many of you will look deeper than the surface level and find out more about one of the oldest natural landmarks known to man. </p> 
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> A brief account of Appalachia</h2>
                        <p>As early as around 8,000 years ago, Native Americans had begun inhabiting Appalachia and its mountainous regions throughout the Northern and Southern portions of today’s USA. 
                        One of the largest tribes is found in the cave systems of Kentucky and Alabama from around 6000 BCE. 
                        One of the largest of the native tribes pre-dating the European colonization of the area, was the Hopewell making large mound structures in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Tennessee. 
                        As they started to decline around 1300 CE for unknown reasons, scholars attributed it to warfare and dwindling trade along the range which then gave way to other Mississippian cultures of southern Appalachians.
                         The South was dominated primarily by the warring tribe of the Cherokee and the North by the Algonquin tribes and Iroquois. 
                         These tribes had a combined population of around 60,000 until the European settlement came to the mountains.</p>
                         <h2 class="section-heading"> Early Settlers </h2>
                        <p>In the 16th century, some Spanish settlers came in through Florida mainly associating with the Cherokee tribes trading with them the many natural resources they had, mainly being furs, so that they could keep their land and benefit from the many different grains the Spanish provided. 200 years later though, European migration became rapid and expansive. Many from the British Isles and Germany were moving in along with many from England and Scotland. Many of the settlers were in the poorer class of people and wished to establish their own farms and land away from the ongoing wars. Many of these poor people brought many slaves with them, being 10% of the population by 1860 and they continued to encroach on the native's land as time went on. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> The Appalachian Identity and the <U class="S"></U> </h2>
                        <p>After European settlers were established in the backcountry the identity of self-reliance and independence became widespread, and many of the Appalachian people became romantic figures to many colonists. Explorers like Daniel Boone evoked images of fur skin hats, horseback riding, and trekking out into the undiscovered wilderness was the embodiment of the desires many had for their lives. Before the Revolutionary War, many of these poor settlers who had been released from indentured servitude moved into the mountains getting caught up in many different conflicts like Bacon’s rebellion or Culpepper’s rebellion that were sparked by territory and land conflicts. After the war, many veterans were given land rights, though this displaced many Native Americans and forced them out due to the many threats the tribes had posed before the war to settlers. </p>
